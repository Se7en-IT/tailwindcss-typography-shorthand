# Tailwindcss Typography Shorthand

Are you tired to write "text-lg font-bold tracking-wide font-sans"?

This plugin is a shorthand for all of these:

__typog-{fontSize\*}-{fontWeight\*}-{letterSpacing}-{fontFamily}__

\* required

*Example: typog-lg-bold-wide-sans*

Why didn't I put "lineHeight" property?
Because lineHeight is set with fontSize in tailwind.config.js
